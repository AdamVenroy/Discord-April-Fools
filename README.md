On April 1 2024, Discord added loot boxes for April Fools. Each drop in the box had an equal chance of appearing,
and a reward was given once they had received every drop. The purpose of this program 
is to simply simulate the game and draw the distribution of the amount of loot 
required to receive the award.

Results showed that the median was 23 loot boxes, and a average of 25.4573. The
distribution shape is log-normal.
